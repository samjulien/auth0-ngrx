# Auth0 NgRx (Draft)

This is a very drafty demo of implementing Auth0 in an NgRx application. It's based on Brandon Roberts' [authentication demo](https://github.com/brandonroberts/ngrx-ngconf-2018) he used for ng-conf 2018. Brandon's demo is also a simplified version of example app in the [NgRx platform](https://github.com/ngrx/platform).

This is an Angular CLI 6 project, so standard commands like `ng serve` apply.
